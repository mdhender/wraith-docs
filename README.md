# Wraith Documentation
Wraith is a clone of
[Empyrean Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empyrean_Challenge)
with infrastructure borrowed from
[Far Horizons](https://github.com/Ramblurr/Far-Horizons).

Wraith aspires to be like
[The Campaign for North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Campaign_for_North_Africa)
and focus on strategy and logistics,
which I hope will be as important to Wraith.

## Empyrean Challenge
[Empyrean Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empyrean_Challenge)
is a computer moderated play by mail game created in 1978 by Vern Holford of Superior Simulations.

Players used the rulebook to format the orders, determine the sequence of play,
and understand what the individual units were capable of.

They mailed their hand-written (or typed) orders each turn.
The orders were keyed into the computer system.
Vern's program ran and calculated the results.
Reports were printed out and mailed back to the players.
